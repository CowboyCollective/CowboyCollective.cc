A cowboy is someone who experiences life like a real-life adventure :^)
We catch our cowboy having a peaceful moment in his o so busy life. While strolling through a seemingly abandoned (and thus safe) site he takes a bite from his juicy apple, taking him back to his earliest memory of experiencing such internal bliss. His mind takes him on the adventure that is his own life, from birth to future, every memory filled with something new and exiting. In the end we see our cowboy again between the empty crates, enjoying his apple, o how nice it must be to live the cowboy-life!
