      <h1> Pulp Archive </h1>
      <h2> <b><a href="http://localhost:4000/cowboy/Owen Earl">OWEN EARL</a></b> &nbsp; 16&nbsp;April&nbsp;2021 <br></h2><p>Lookin&rsquo;<br>A library of old cowboy pulp magazines</p>
      <br>
      
      
      
      
      <h2 id="-visit-archive-"><a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/pulp/"><b>★ VISIT ARCHIVE ★</b></a></h2>

<p><br />The <em><a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/pulp/">Cowboy Collective Pulp Archive</a></em> is a library of over 100 cowboy-themed pulp magazines and comics, dating all the way back to the 1800s. It features high-quality scans that can be navigated like a book, with the option to download the magazines/comics in a PDF format. These are all in the public domain, so feel free to remix and redistribute at your leisure. I will continue to expand the <em>Cowboy Collective Pulp Archive</em> with time, so be sure to check back in the future.</p>

<p><strong>The Inspiration</strong><br />I’m working on a Cowboy Collective project that is unrelated and will hopefully be ready to share soon. For this other project I need some cowboy illustrations, but I’m not advanced enough at drawing to do this myself, so I started searching around the internet for public domain sources of cowboy drawings.</p>

<p>Eventually I stumbled upon a PDF of a 1940s cowboy pulp magazine, and felt I had hit the jackpot. The thing is chalk-full of dynamic cowboy illustrations, but I also liked paging through it and reading the absurd ads for “giant frogs” and “learning electricity.” I downloaded the magazine, and spotted another. I downloaded that one too, and spotted another. My collection kept growing, until I was unable to remember if I had already downloaded a magazine or if it was new. If only there was a way to keep track of all these magazines!</p>

<p><strong>Building the Archive</strong><br />I decided it would be a worthwhile diversion if I built a little archive of the cowboy pulp magazines, if only for myself. I started writing down the name, date, and volume/issue number of the magazines until I had over 100 entries.</p>

<p>The majority of the magazines were coming from archive.org, which has a brilliant little feature that lets you turn through the pages as if you are reading a physical book without downloading it. I love it and decided I would like to build a web page that would act like a library, where you could pick up a magazine that catches your eye, flip through it, and put it back.</p>

<p>Archive.org has some smart formatting, in that there is a predictable hyperlink for everything, so if you have a link to a PDF (https://archive.org/download/1926-05-frontier-stories-v-004n-002/1926-05%20Frontier%20Stories%20v004n002.pdf) you could figure out the link to embed the page-turning feature on your site (https://archive.org/embed/1926-05-frontier-stories-v-004n-002/) as well as the cover image (https://archive.org/download/1926-05-frontier-stories-v-004n-002/__ia_thumb.jpg).</p>

<p>This is great because I will only have to write down one link per entry, and the computer can figure out the other necessary information.</p>

<p>It does mean that for pulp magazines not already on archive.org, copies have been uploaded to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/@cowboy_collective">Cowboy Collective page</a>. I am proud to feel as though I am contributing to something as cool as the archive.org library.</p>

<p>I would like to acknowledge the amazing time, energy, and expertise that has gone into the many projects that make this archive possible, including <a href="https://archive.org">archive.org</a>, the <a href="https://www.pulpmags.org">Pulp Magazines Project</a>, and Phil Stephensen-Payne’s incredible <a href="http://www.philsp.com/homeville/fmi/0start.htm">FictionMags Index</a>.</p>

<p>The hope is the <em><a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/pulp/">Cowboy Collective Pulp Archive</a></em> makes discovering and navigating cowboy themed pulp magazines and comics easy and fun.</p>
